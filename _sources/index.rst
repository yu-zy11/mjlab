What is mjlab?
==============

**mjlab = Isaac Lab's API + MuJoCo's simplicity + GPU acceleration**

We took Isaac Lab's proven manager-based architecture and RL abstractions,
then built them directly on MuJoCo Warp. No translation layers, no Omniverse
overhead. Just fast, transparent physics.

You can try mjlab *without installing anything* by using `uvx`:

.. code-block:: bash

   # Install uv if you haven't already
   curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

   # Run the mjlab demo (no local installation needed)
   uvx --from mjlab \
       --with "mujoco-warp @ git+https://github.com/google-deepmind/mujoco_warp@7c20a44bfed722e6415235792a1b247ea6b6a6d3" \
       demo

If this runs, your setup is compatible with mjlab *for evaluation*.

Acknowledgments
===============

mjlab would not exist without the excellent work of the Isaac Lab team, whose API design
and abstractions mjlab builds upon.

Thanks also to the MuJoCo Warp team — especially Erik Frey and Taylor Howell — for
answering our questions, giving helpful feedback, and implementing features based
on our requests countless times.
