NaN Guard
=========

The NaN guard captures simulation states when NaN/Inf is detected, helping debug
numerical instability issues.

TL;DR
-----

**Running into NaN issues during training?** Enable the NaN guard with a single flag:

.. code-block:: bash

    uv run train.py --enable-nan-guard True


This will automatically capture and save simulation states when NaN/Inf is
detected, making it easy to debug what went wrong.

You can also enable it programmatically in your simulation config:

.. code-block:: python

    from mjlab.sim.sim import SimulationCfg
    from mjlab.utils.nan_guard import NanGuardCfg

    cfg = SimulationCfg(
        nan_guard=NanGuardCfg(
            enabled=True,
            buffer_size=100,
            output_dir="/tmp/mjlab/nan_dumps",
            max_envs_to_dump=5,
        ),
    )

Configuration
-------------

``enabled`` (default: ``False``)
Enable/disable NaN detection and dumping. When disabled, has minimal overhead.

``buffer_size`` (default: ``100``)
Number of recent simulation states to keep in rolling buffer.

``output_dir`` (default: ``"/tmp/mjlab/nan_dumps"``)
Directory where NaN dump files are saved.

``max_envs_to_dump`` (default: ``5``) Maximum number of NaN environments to dump
to disk. All environments are tracked in the buffer, but only the first N NaN
environments are saved to reduce dump size.

Behavior
--------

- **Captures** simulation state before each step (using ``mj_getState``)
- **Detects** NaN/Inf in ``qpos``, ``qvel``, ``qacc``, ``qacc_warmstart`` after each step
- **Dumps** buffer and model to disk on first detection
- **Exits** only dumps once per training run to avoid spam

Output Format
-------------

Each NaN detection creates timestamped files plus latest symlinks:

- ``nan_dump_TIMESTAMP.npz`` - Compressed state buffer
  - ``states_step_NNNNNN`` - Captured states for each step (shape: ``[num_envs_dumped, state_size]``)
  - ``_metadata`` - Dict with ``num_envs_total``, ``nan_env_ids``, ``dumped_env_ids``, etc.
- ``model_TIMESTAMP.mjb`` - MuJoCo model in binary format
- ``nan_dump_latest.npz`` - Symlink to most recent dump
- ``model_latest.mjb`` - Symlink to most recent model

Visualizing Dumps
-----------------

Use the interactive viewer to scrub through captured states:

.. code-block:: bash

    # View latest dump.
    uv run viz-nan /tmp/mjlab/nan_dumps/nan_dump_latest.npz

    # Or view a specific dump.
    uv run viz-nan /tmp/mjlab/nan_dumps/nan_dump_20251014_123456.npz

   NaN debug viewer.

The viewer provides:

- Step slider to scrub through the buffer
- Environment slider to compare different environments
- Info panel showing which environments have NaN/Inf
- 3D visualization of the robot and terrain at each state

This makes it easy to see exactly what went wrong and compare crashed
environments against clean ones.

Performance
-----------

When disabled (``enabled=False``), all operations are no-ops with
negligible overhead. When enabled, overhead scales with ``buffer_size`` and
``max_envs_to_capture``.

NaN Detection Termination
-------------------------

While ``nan_guard`` helps **debug** NaN issues by capturing states, you can also
**prevent** training crashes using the ``nan_detection`` termination:

.. code-block:: python

    from mjlab.envs.mdp.terminations import nan_detection
    from mjlab.managers.termination_manager import TerminationTermCfg

    # In your termination config:
    nan_term: TerminationTermCfg = field(
        default_factory=lambda: TerminationTermCfg(
            func=nan_detection,
            time_out=False
        )
    )


This marks NaN environments as terminated, allowing them to reset while training
continues. Terminations are logged as ``Episode_Termination/nan_term`` in your
metrics.

.. important::

     ``nan_detection`` is a band-aid, not a cure. If NaNs occur
     during your task objective (e.g., your task is to grasp objects but NaNs
     happen when grasping), the policy will never learn to complete the task since
     it resets before receiving rewards. Monitor your ``Episode_Termination/nan_term``
     metrics carefully.

**When to use which:**

- ``nan_guard``: Debug and understand why NaNs occur (always do this first)
- ``nan_detection``: Keep training stable while working on a permanent fix
